# Localization
Currently working on 2 Machine learning based projects under this segment:
1. # Crowd estimation using Wifi :
   Estimating the number of people in the crowd can go a long way in resolving problems related to security, establishing systems
   for crowd control, disaster management etc. The objective of this project is to build an effective system to control crowd 
   localization by giving real time updates about the number of people accessing each of the exits present in a building in the 
   event of a disaster.
   The project is under development. Feel free to contact in case you are interested to collaborate.
   
2. Object localisation
